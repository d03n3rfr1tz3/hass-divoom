**Divoom Integration for Home Assistant**

Allows you to send commands to your Divoom device through a Home Assistant notification service. It allows you to control your Divoom device
in your automations and scripts however you want. Currently no reading commands or sensors are implemented, because everything works through
a Notification Service. Just send controls/animations to your Divoom device through that Notification Service.

## Requirements
For this component to actually have chance to work, it needs a Bluetooth Classic connection. Unlike Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Bluetooth Classic,
as the name already indicates, is a bit older. Therefore it brings some difficulties with it, which you might not expect, when you only know BLE
devices. One for example is that the Bluetooth Proxies from Home Assistant/ ESPHome do only support BLE and therefore cannot be used with this
component. Another one is the support in Python itself. While a Bluetooth Classic connection is supported natively by Python, the pairing process
is not. That's why you very likely have to do some manual work, if you somehow did not do it already.

As an alternative for directly connecting your Home Assistant via Bluetooth to your Divoom device, you can use my [Bluetooth Proxy for ESP32](https://github.com/d03n3rfr1tz3/esp32-divoom).
With this you don't have to fiddle around with Bluetooth Pairing in your Home Assistant. It's currently still WIP, so there might be some minor issues here and there.
If you are using my Bluetooth Proxy for ESP32, you can skip the whole Bluetooth Hardware and Bluetooth Pairing parts of this documentation.

#### Bluetooth Hardware
Of course you need Bluetooth hardware for that. It does not matter if you use the integrated Bluetooth controller of a Raspberry Pi 3/4/5 or an
additional dongle. As long as it supports a classic Bluetooth connection via RFCOMM, you are good to go. When in doubt, just try it or have a
look at the following part of the Home Assistant documentation: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth/

#### Bluetooth Pairing
As described above, you need to pair your Divoom device at least once to your Home Assistant device. After the pairing is done, this component
can connect to your Divoom device anytime it's needed, even after restarting your Home Assistant. You have multiple possibilities to pair your
Home Assistant to your Divoom device. The following commands can be used to pair your devices. Use them via SSH.

* `bluetoothctl` and then `pair DIVOOM_DEVICE_MAC` and optionally also `connect DIVOOM_DEVICE_MAC` \
OR
* `rfcomm connect HCI_DEVICE DIVOOM_DEVICE_MAC DIVOOM_DEVICE_PORT`

Choose what fits your Home Assistant installation or host system best. `bluetoothctl` is the more modern way and should be available even on
very basic HASS.io installations. `rfcomm` and maybe even `hciconfig hci0 up` beforehand is an older way. Obviously you have to fill in
some placeholders above.

* `HCI_DEVICE`: The id of your Bluetooth controller. Typically just `hci0`, especially if you are using integrated Raspberry Pi Bluetooth.
* `DIVOOM_DEVICE_MAC`: The MAC address of your Divoom device. You can either get it via the Divoom App or by scanning for it.
* `DIVOOM_DEVICE_PORT`: The port of your Divoom device. Typically its just `1`, but on some audio-supported devices it might be `2`.

## Installation
First we need to install the component. That can be done in two ways: Easy or Manual

### Easy Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=d03n3rfr1tz3&repository=hass-divoom&category=integration)

* Use HACS
* ...
* Profit

### Manual Installation

* Download the repository. If you know git, a clone is fine. If not,
  just download https://github.com/d03n3rfr1tz3/hass-divoom/archive/main.zip
  to get the most recent code in a ZIP file.
* Copy the corresponding content of the ZIP file into `custom_components\divoom` in your Home Assistant
  configuration directory.
* Create a directory named `pixelart` in your Home Assistant configuration directory,
  for images that you may want to display on your device.
* Optionally copy the content of the `pixelart` directory from the ZIP file

## Configuration
Second we need to enable/ configure the component. Again that can be done in two ways: Easy or Manual

### Easy Configuration

* Go to Integrations
* If there is an auto-discovered entry, you are lucky and can skip two steps
* Use `Add Integration` and Search for `Divoom`
* Choose your Divoom device from the list of discovered Bluetooth devices
* Choose a `port`. If you are unsure, first try `1`. If that doesn't work, try `2`.
* Select your device type (e.g. `pixoo`, `ditoo` and such)
* Click Send and then Finish

Beware that the UI configuration currently does not fully support my [Bluetooth Proxy for ESP32](https://github.com/d03n3rfr1tz3/esp32-divoom).
Currently it is supported through auto-discovery via ZeroConf, as well as through the UI configuration by setting the `host` option. It does not
add to the list of discovered Bluetooth devices, which means you have to manually type the MAC address in that case.

### Manual Configuration
This can be done by manually adding the following snippet to your `configuration.yaml`
and filling in the capitalized placeholders. You can create a notify service for every
Divoom device you have, therefore allowing you to add multiple of these snippets.

```yaml
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: divoom
    host: "PROXY_HOST_OR_IP"
    mac: "DIVOOM_DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS"
    port: DIVOOM_DEVICE_PORT
    device_type: "DIVOOM_DEVICE_TYPE"
    media_directory: "pixelart"
    escape_payload: false
```

* `name` (Recommended): The name for the notify service.
* `host` (Optional): The host or IP of your ESP32 with flashed [Bluetooth Proxy](https://github.com/d03n3rfr1tz3/esp32-divoom).
  Beware, that an ESPHome BLE Proxy does not work, because Divoom is using Bluetooth Classic and not Bluetooth Low-Energy.
  Just leave it out, if you want your Home Assistant to directly connect via Bluetooth.
* `mac` (Required): The Bluetooth MAC address for the Divoom device.
* `port` (Optional): The Bluetooth channel for the Divoom device. Typically 1, but might be 2 for some devices with audio features.
* `device_type`: The concrete type of your Divoom device. \
  Currently `ditoo`, `pixoo`, `pixoomax`, `timebox`, `timeboxmini`, `tivoo` are supported.
* `media_directory` (Required): A directory, relative to the configuration dir, containing image
  files in GIF format. The component will use these to display static or animated images on the device.
* `escape_payload` (Optional): Adds escaping of the payload, which might be important for some older Divoom devices with
  older firmware (afaik some old Timebox versions). Deactivated by default, because newer versions don't need that.

Here is an example how it could look like.
```yaml
notify:
  - name: Divoom Pixoo
    platform: divoom
    mac: "12:34:56:78:9A"
    port: 1
    device_type: "pixoo"
    media_directory: "pixelart"
    escape_payload: false
```

```yaml
notify:
  - name: Divoom Ditoo
    platform: divoom
    host: "192.168.0.123"
    mac: "12:34:56:78:9A"
    port: 2
    device_type: "ditoo"
    media_directory: "pixelart"
    escape_payload: false
```

## Usage

This custom component acts as a notify service. This means that the
Service Data requires a message parameter, which basically is the
command/mode we are sending to the device. Some commands/modes need
additional parameters, which should be provided in the service data
payload.

There was also an older style, where the message would be left empty
and the mode also passed in through the service data. It is still
supported as of today, but because it looks odd and confuses people,
it's not the preferred way anymore.

### Basic Modes
The general structure for all modes are similar, but each mode has different parameter. Below the example
of the basic structure, you can find a documentation of each mode.

Modern:
```yaml
service: notify.NOTIFIER_NAME
data:
  message: "MODE"
  data:
    parameter: value
```

Classic:
```yaml
service: notify.NOTIFIER_NAME
data:
  message: ""
  data:
    mode: "MODE"
    parameter: value
```

## Troubleshooting
### Cannot connect
Make sure, that you at least paired your Home Assistant device once to your Divoom device. Also make sure, that you have the correct MAC address.
Also make sure, that your Phone is not currently connected to your Divoom device, because some don't allow that many connections.

If it seems to connect, but looses connection the moment you use any mode, you might have chosen the wrong port. On Pixoo and other non-audio
devices, it's typically `port: 1`. But on audio devices, like the Tivoo or Ditoo, it might be `port: 2`.

### GIF does not work

The most common problem is, that the GIF does not have the correct size or format. The Divoom devices (and to some extend my code) are nitpicky in that case. Strangly enough the Divoom app lets you download GIFs, but these are typically in the size of 320x320 and not fitting your device.
Your GIF needs to be exactly the size of your Divoom screen (*16x16* in case of a Pixoo or similar sized device), *non-interlaced* and with a *global color palette*.

I can recommend resizing and converting your GIFs with GIMP. Of course other software might also work, depending on the export/format options. When resizing a GIF downloaded from the Divoom app with GIMP, you better choose no interpolation to not blur your GIF. When exporting with GIMP, make sure to mark the animation checkbox and don't mark the interlace checkbox. For a few more details and an example look into the following comment: https://github.com/d03n3rfr1tz3/hass-divoom/issues/19#issuecomment-1982059358

## Credits
A lot of the bluetooth communication with the Divoom device is based on gathering information from multiple sources, that already
reverse engineered an older or different Divoom device. Only because of this, I could reverse engineer more commands myself. Therefore
credit goes to the following owners and git repos (you are the heroes here):

https://github.com/RomRider/node-divoom-timebox-evo/ (especially for the [protocol documentation](https://github.com/RomRider/node-divoom-timebox-evo/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md))  
https://github.com/mumpitzstuff/fhem-Divoom  
https://github.com/ScR4tCh/timebox/  
https://bitbucket.org/pjhardy/homeassistant-timebox/src/master/

Also thanks to whoever made the following (official?) documentation of most of the Divoom protocol. Even while it does not have the latest
commands available in the Ditoo, it still helped a lot in refining and completing stuff. \
